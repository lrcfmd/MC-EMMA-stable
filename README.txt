********************************************

This is the current stable version of MC-EMMA, originally published in this paper: and is provided "as is" under the GNU public licence

https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22374


********************************************

Requirements for MC-EMMA:

The atomic simulation environment (ase), this can be installed via pip
To run energu calculations, you will also need a copy of GULP, avalible for free to academic users from here: http://gulp.curtin.edu.au/gulp/

once ase is installed, to setup MC-EMMA type:

python setup.py install.

********************************************

The current version of MC-EMMA only supports using GULP as the energy calculator, we plan to add VASP at a later date. If there is any other chemistry code that you would like to include which is on the list supported by the atomic simulation environment (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) please get in touch!

The instructions below assume that you have GULP installed as per the guidelines provieded by ase: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/gulp.html#module-ase.calculators.gulp

********************************************

How to run MC-EMMA:

To run an MC-EMMA calculation, you will need to have a copy of "mc_emma.py", "restart_gulp.py", your input file and a potential library for GULP calculations.  To execute the calculation, run the following command from the command line:
python < [MY_INPUT]].py > [MY_OUTPUT]

Guide to MC-EMMA input file:

In this data repository, there are several example input files for MC-EMMA, for the calculations we performed in this work, below is a brief guide to create new input files for MC-EMMA:
1) Import commands: you will need to include the following three import statements:
"from mc_emma import * "
"import numpy"
"import sys"

2) creating/importing modules:
If creating new modules in the input file, you will need to specify the following:
ap = x  >> a floating point number, to set the realspace size of input modules
rep = [a,b,c] >> required if you wish to tile any of the input modules in x,y or z by a,b or c repeats

making new modules:
To run an MC-EMMA calculation, you will need to create at least one a and one b module. This can be done in one of two ways:
1)	Create a module as a new "Atoms" object from the atomic simulation environment (see https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/, for full documentation), briefly, here is an example of creating a new module:

Create the atoms object (by setting the atomic formula, then the unit cell then periodic boundary conditions:
A1=Atoms("Ba4O4",cell=[2.*ap,2.*ap,0.5*ap],pbc=[1,1,1])

Set the scaled positions for each of the atoms:
A1.set_scaled_positions([[0.,0.,0.5],[0.5,0.,0.5],[0.,0.5,0.5],[0.5,0.5,0.5],[0.25,0.25,0.5],[0.75,0.25,0.5],[0.25,0.75,0.5],[0.75,0.75,0.5]])

If required tile the new atoms object:
A1=A1.repeat(rep)

2)	By reading in an existing structure file to use as a module:
This can be done with the following command:
A1= read("my_module.cif")
NOTE: Each of the modules needs to have the same a and b lattice parameters (although a does not have to be equal to b!), but different c parameters is permitted!

Grouping modules:
Before executing the MC-EMMA calculation, you will need to group your modules in to either "a" or "b" modules, you can do this by setting the following lists (after defining your modules):
AMods=[A1,A2, ... ,An]
BMods=[B1,B2, ... ,Bn]

The mc function:
This is the main function to execute an MC-EMMA calculation, In order to use, you need to have the following command at the end of your input file:
mc(<options>)

The options are as follows (options highlighted with a * either side of the option name are required for a typical calculation):

*kwds*: a list containing keywords used for a gulp calculation (e.g. kwds=["opti conp"])

*opts*: a listing containin options for a gulp calculation (e.g. opts=["library library.lib"])

*shel*: a dictionay object, required if your interatomic potentials require any shells (e.g. shel=["Ca","O"] to apply shells to Ca and O ions)

*A_Mods*: the dictionary object to define the "a" modules for the calculation, the key to the dictionary is the type of stackging to use for the calculation: "orthorhombic" indicates that MC-EMMA should use cubic packing to assemble structures. "hexagonal" indicates that MC-EMMA should use close packing. the input should look like: A_Mods={"orthorhombic":AMods}

*B_Mods*: the dictionary object to defins the "b" modules for the calculation, with the same formatting as for A_Mods.

*charges*: Dictionary object to indicate the formal charges on each of the input species (e.g. charges={"Ca":+2, "O":-2}

*composition*: dictionary object to indicate the empirical formula for the calculation, this needs to be normalised such that the smallest component is equal to 1. (e.g for Ca2FeO5 use: composition = {"Ca":1,"Fe":1,"O":2.5}, note that the order of the species does not matter.

*sl*: the set of stacking lengths to use for the calculation: can be specified as a range or a list, when using a range, make the largest number 1 higher that the maximum required length (e.g sl= range(1,5) or sl= [1,2,3,4] to generate structures with stacking lengths between 1 and 4 layers)

*startup*: tells MC-EMMA how to start: 2 = start fresh calculation, 3 = restart from a previous run

*smax*: this is how many steps to perform in one run; this exisits so that an entire calculation does not need to be performed in one go, useful for when executing calculations on clusters where it would take longer than the allowed cpu time! (after the first run set startup = 3 to continue the calculation)

*rmax*: the parameter used to dertermine when to stop the calculation

*smin*: the minimum number of structures required before stopping a calculation

ratt_dist : a parameter by which atoms are randomly displaced from their starting positions before starting a geometry relaxation. The number specified is a standard deviation in Angstroms. (e.g ratt_dist= 0.1)

*red_T*: the reduced temperature parameter for the Monte-Carlo loop

delay (typically zero): if this is specified as non-zero, MC-EMMA will only use swap types 1 and 2 for n steps after accepting a new structure: this can be useful to allow a calculation to settle out after accepting a swap.

pert: this is a list to indicate which swaps to use (as defined in the paper), if it is not specified, MC-EMMA will use default values) and the weighting applied to each swap type, note that you do not have to specify all 6 possible swap types!. (e.g.pert = (["T1",10],["T2",5] ï¿½ etc )

kmax: you should not need to alter this; this is the total number of attempts MC-EMMA will try to make a random structure with a given module set.
tmax: when initialising the calculation, this is the number of attempts MC-EMMA will try to generate a structure at a given stacking length before increasing (it will start with the smallest and move towards the largest). the number should be increased if MC-EMMA returns an error message indicating it could not make a starting structure. Although increasing this may lead to a significant increase in computing time to generate the initial structure. Note: the other reason for this error message may be that it is not possible to generate a structure with your input modules and/or composition (please double check both of these manually to ensure that you input is correct!)

*****************************************************************************************

TODO:

Include an example file using the "hexagonal" input option

Include the VASP calculator & example(s)

****************************************************************************************

KNOWN ISSUES:

 - There seems to be an intermitant issue when using Linux / MAC machines where MC-EMMA is unable to correctly read the output from GULP calculations, this manifests as each structure being listed as "failed" and the corrisponding energy set to 1E20 / number of atoms.
